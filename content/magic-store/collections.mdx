## Create a collection

Collections are groups of products that are displayed separately in the header navigation and will have their own page.

<Feedback marginTop="16" icon vertical="center" description={<>The <InlineCode>All products</InlineCode> collection is a special collection that is always displayed first and contains all products. You don't need to create a collection for all products.</>}/>

You can create a new collection for your store on the [Collections](https://my-shop.fourthwall.com/admin/dashboard/products/collections/) page.

## Order collections

Since Fourthwall doesn't provide a native way for ordering collections, Magic Store has a custom implementation that allows you to order collections by adding a number to the very beginning of the collection name. This number is going to be stripped from the collection name on the interface and will only be used for ordering.
