## Create a product

After signing up on [Fourthwall](https://link.fourthwall.com/ref/design-engineers-club), you can add products and collections to your store on the [All Products](https://my-shop.fourthwall.com/admin/dashboard/products/all/) page.

![Create a new product](/images/docs/magic-store/add-product-1.jpg)

Select the "Design something new" option and choose from a wide range of high quality products. Find reviews, compare prices, and choose from available printing technologies.

Design your product with a simple, drag-and-drop interface.

Once you publish the product, it will automatically appear in your store. Magic Store is a custom storefront, so you don't have to publish your store on Fourthwall.

## Featured products

Featured products appear on the homepage in a carousel format. It's a way to highlight your trending products.

Manage featured products in Magic Store's `resources/config.js` file:

<CodeBlock marginBottom="16" highlight="3-6" codes={[
  {
    code:
`const featuredProducts = [
    {
      promoImage: '/images/featured-1.jpg',
      title: 'Title for product 1', //optional
      description: 'Description for product 1', //optional
      relatedProduct: 'product-1' //product slug
    },
    {
      promoImage: '/images/featured-2.jpg',
      title: 'Title for product 2', //optional
      description: 'Description for product 2', //optional
      relatedProduct: 'product-2'
    }
];`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "app/resources/config.js"
  }
]} />

The `promoImage` property is the path to the image that will be displayed as the carousel slide background. The `relatedProduct` property is the slug of the product that will be rendered in the bottom left corner with a link to the product. The `title` and `description` properties are optional and can be used to provide more information about the product.

## Ordering products

You can change the order of product in your Fourthwall store by dragging and dropping the products in the [All Products](https://my-shop.fourthwall.com/admin/dashboard/products/all/) page in the desired order, or by clicking the more actions (three dots) icon and then choosing the "Change position" button.
