## Add size guides to your products

Since the Fourthwall API doesn't return size guides, you need to add them manually to the `resources/size-guide.js` file.

<CodeBlock
    codeHeight={24}
    marginBottom="24"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const sizeGuide = {
    "product-slug": {
      image: "/images/sizeGuide/product-1.webp", // optional but recommended
      sizes: [
        {
          label: "S",
          "length (A)": 26.6,
          "width (B)": 18.3,
          "sleeve (C)": 16.3
        },
        {
          label: "M",
          "length (A)": 28,
          "width (B)": 20.3,
          "sleeve (C)": 17.8
        },
        {
          label: "L",
          "length (A)": 29.4,
          "width (B)": 22,
          "sleeve (C)": 19
        },
        {
          label: "XL",
          "length (A)": 30.8,
          "width (B)": 24,
          "sleeve (C)": 20.5
        },
        {
          label: "2XL",
          "length (A)": 31.6,
          "width (B)": 26,
          "sleeve (C)": 21.8
        },
        {
          label: "3XL",
          "length (A)": 32.5,
          "width (B)": 27.8,
          "sleeve (C)": 23.3
        },
        {
          label: "4XL",
          "length (A)": 33.5,
          "width (B)": 29.8,
          "sleeve (C)": 24.6
        }
      ]
    },
};`, 
    language: "tsx",
    label: "app/resources/size-guide.js"
  }
]} />

The size guide will be available on the product page for the matching product slug.

  It's important that you update the product slug in the <InlineCode>resources/size-guide.js</InlineCode> file if the product slug changes.

## Size guide reference

You can find the size guide for each product by navigating to the [original storefront](https://my-shop.fourthwall.com/admin/dashboard/store-design/layout/index/) provided by Fourthwall and opening the size guide dialog:

![Size guide](/images/docs/magic-store/size-guide-2.jpg)

You can save the image from here and add the measurements in the config file in inches. The measurements will be automatically calculated and displayed in centimeters in the size guide dialog.
