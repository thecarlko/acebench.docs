## Banner

You can use the banner to display promotions or discounts for your store. You can add a custom banner that appears on all pages of your store by editing the `banner` object in the `config.js` file.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const banner = {
    display: true,
    content: <><Icon size="xs" onSolid="brand-strong" name="cart"/>Free delivery on orders above $75</>,
};`, 
    language: "tsx",
    label: "app/resources/config.js"
  }
]} />
