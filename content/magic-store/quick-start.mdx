## About

Magic Store is a complete e-commerce solution built with Once UI and powered by Fourthwall. Once UI provides an easy-to-customize and responsive storefront, while Fourthwall handles the payment processing, manufacturing and shipping. You can set up a fully-functional e-commerce store with Magic Store in minutes, without writing a single line of code.

Magic Store is licensed under the [Dopler CC license](https://once-ui.com/products/magic-store). The license allows for personal, internal or external and commercial use, but prohibits distribution of the source code, redistribution, or monetization of the source code in any way.

## Quick start

Clone the git repository:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "git clone https://github.com/once-ui-system/magic-store.git",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

Install the necessary dependencies:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm install",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

Start the local development server:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm run dev",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

## Next steps

1. [Set up a store](https://link.fourthwall.com/ref/design-engineers-club) on Fourthwall.
2. [Make some products](https://my-shop.fourthwall.com/admin/dashboard/products/all/) and [create a collection](https://my-shop.fourthwall.com/admin/dashboard/products/collections/).
3. After you have signed up, [get a storefront token](https://my-shop.fourthwall.com/admin/dashboard/settings/for-developers).
4. Fill out the environment variables below in `.env.local`:

<CodeBlock marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_STOREFRONT_TOKEN="<your storefront token>" # Example: ptkn_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_CHECKOUT="<your store url>" # Example: vercel-shop.fourthwall.com. Used for checkout
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL="<the url of your vercel site>" # Example: fw-commerce.vercel.app. This is used for sitemap.xml + robots.txt.
`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: ".env.local"
  }
]} />

This will sync the products and collections between your Fourthwall store and Magic Store.

5. Add the same variables to your hosting provider's environment variables before deploying the app.
