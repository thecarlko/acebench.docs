## Important

Argus is pending developer certification for the following platforms:
- MacOS
- Windows

If you would like to get access and start using it now, follow the instructions below. Otherwise, fill out the form on the [Start Page](https://argus.engineering/start) to get notified when it is developer approved for your platform.


## Installation
To install Argus, simply download the latest version from the [Download section](https://argus.engineering/#download) for your specific platform.


## MacOS

After installing, save the application to your preferred location. (For this example, we will use the `Desktop` folder.)

Trying to run the application automatically will result in an "app is damaged and can't be opened" error. This happens because Argus is still pending developer approval from Apple to sign and notarize the application. To fix this, first run the following command in the Terminal:

1. Navigate to the folder where you saved the application. 
*Change the path to the folder where you saved the application.*

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```

2. Temporarily approve the application by running the following command:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine Argus.app
```

3. Run the application by double clicking on it OR running the following command:

```bash
open Argus.app
```

Thats it! You should now be able to run the application. If you encounter any issues, please contact us at [support@argus.engineering](mailto:support@argus.engineering).


## Windows

After downloading, navigate to the folder where the app was downloaded (likely the `Downloads` folder) - and double click to open the installer.

You will automatically get a "Windows protected your PC" message. Click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Simply click "Next" and then "Install". You will be prompted to allow the app to make changes to your device. Click "Yes".
*This is to save the application to your device - Argus will never make any file changes to your device without your permission.*

Thats it! You should now be able to run the application. If you encounter any issues, please contact us at [support@argus.engineering](mailto:support@argus.engineering).
