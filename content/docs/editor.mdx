The editor is the core of Acebench. It tells the project how to run. It is designed to be a modular tool. Meaning it can be ran, in parallel, as:
- a standalone tool
- with other tools in the Acebench suite (like the dashboard)
- with external tools (like LabView, Custom c++, python, matlab scripts)

*If you intend to use the editor with other 3rd party tools, each tool must be open in it's own window and running separately.*

### Scripting

The editor allows you to build scripts to control and monitor hardware. Each project is associated with scripts that run ***in parallel*** to each other.
For example, if building a project testing a model rocket, you may structure the scripts as:

**Scripts**
    - *setup* - This script is run once at the beginning of the project. It is used to setup the hardware and software environment.
    - *navigate* - Navigate the rocket to a desired position.
    - *measure* - Determine, record, and upload the rocket's position.
    - *cleanup* - Clean up the hardware and software environment after the project is complete.

Each script is run in parallel, and the results are logged to the dashboard.
