![Argus Mockup](https://argus.engineering/assets/mockup.png)

Argus is a tool purpose built to automate and speed up the hardware validation process - from build to launch. With different tools to let engineers understand, iterate, and improve on their builds as fast as possible. 


## Philosophy

The core tenants guiding this projects' development are **speed**, **collaboration**, and **modularity** &dash; to let users focus on engineering their **products** not engineering the **software** to test it.

In more detail:

**Speed** &dash; In both product experience and performance, this project aims to be the fastest way for engineers to build functioning software to control and test their projects.

**Collaboration** &dash; While this is a tool that can be used by individual engineers, its main focus is to be used in collaborative engineering teams.

**Modularity** &dash; This project aims to be a modular tool, allowing engineers to use only the parts they need.  This is to allow for a more flexible and scalable solution.


## Product
Argus is a platform that does this by providing an integrated suite of tools with insight into hardware products. They are, in order:

- [Editor](/editor) - For building the scripts that control and monitor hardware
- [Dashboard](/dashboard) - For visualizing and logging test data locally.
- [Library](/library) - Record of all the tests involved with each project
