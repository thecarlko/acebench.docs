The dashboard allows you to quickly visualize test data. It works by visualizing data passing through [Data Nodes](/data) in a script.

## Structure

Each project comes with an associated dashboard. Clicking on `Add Widget` at the bottom left of the dashboard will create a new widget viewer to visualize node data.

Before running a script, click the *Expand* icon on the top left of a widget and choose its data source. Then, click run to start the script. Here is a simple example with the data node `battery-level` and the code node `while`.
