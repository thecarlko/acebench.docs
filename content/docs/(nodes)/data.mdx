title: Data Node
description: Recording data for with each run in real time - can be visualized with the dashboard
---

Data nodes are used to record data with a test **in real time**. They can accept any data type, and simply return it after recording it.

- Nodes meant to be used with the [Dashboard](/dashboard) can only accept `number` data types.
- They cannot perform actions, they can only record data.
- Their ID must be unique (or they will be overwritten by a different node), and in all lower case.

## Example
Recording the battery level of your computer:

Code Node:
```python
import subprocess
import re

def main() -> int:
    output = subprocess.check_output(["pmset", "-g", "batt"]).decode("utf-8")
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)%', output)
    if match:
        return int(match.group(1))
    return -1
```

Data Node:
| ID  | Type | Delimeter |
|----|------|---------|
| battery-level | number | 1000ms |

This would record the battery level *(or -1 if it cannot be found)* every 1000ms whenever the project is running.

## Note:
The project as it is currently setup would only run one time. To run the project and record data continuously, you must add a [While Node](/while) to the script.
