title: While Node
description: Performing actions continuously
---

The while node is used to perform actions continuously over time. It has only one requirement:
**The final node in the body must return a `boolean` value.**

## Example
Combining the while node with [Code Node](/code) allows you to perform actions continuously over time, and combining it with a [Data Node](/data) allows you to record data continuously.

For example, to record the battery level of your computer every half second *(500ms)*, as long as the battery level is greater than 20%, you could use the following nodes connected together:

### Code Node:
```python
import subprocess
import re

def main() -> int:
    output = subprocess.check_output(["pmset", "-g", "batt"]).decode("utf-8")
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)%', output)
    if match:
        return int(match.group(1))
    return -1
```

### Data Node:
| ID  | Type | Delimeter |
|----|------|---------|
| battery-level | number | 500ms |

### Code Node (Condition):
```python
def main(input) -> bool:
    return input >= 20
```

### Finished Example
The finished example, combining all these nodes should look like this:
The node `Final` and any other after it will run after the loop breaks (in this case when the battery level is less than 20%).
