title: Scripts
description: The fundamental control blocks of Acebench

Each script is composed of a series of **Nodes** connected to each other by **Edges** that represent the flow of data between them. 

## Nodes

There are 3 main types of nodes:

- **Code** - These nodes are used to control hardware and perform actions.
- **Data** - Record and visualize data. They are most useful when used in conjunction with the [Dashboard](/dashboard) tool.
- **While** - Perform actions while a condition is met.


## Edges

Edges are used to connect nodes to each other. They not only represent the flow of data between them, but also the order in which they are run.

If no data is passed between nodes, the edge is still required to connect them.
