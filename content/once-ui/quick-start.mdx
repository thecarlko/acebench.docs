## Quick start

Create a new Once UI app with our starter repository. It will install dependencies and set up the recommended structure:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16"
codes={[
  {
    code: "npx create-once-ui-app@latest my-app",
    language: "bash",
    label: "CLI"
  },
  {
    code: "git clone https://github.com/once-ui-system/nextjs-starter.git",
    language: "bash",
    label: "Manual"
  }
]} />

Or add Once UI to an existing project:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm install @once-ui-system/core",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />
