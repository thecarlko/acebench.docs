Once UI's color system is designed to be accessible and consistent, allowing you to create
harmonious, functional interfaces. It consists of two layers: the{" "}
`base layer` that contains all possible color tokens and the{" "}
`semantic layer` that aliases the base tokens to give them
meaningful names.

## Base tokens

In Once UI, we call the different color spaces `schemes`. Color tokens
are constructed from pairing a scheme with a weight, such as `sand-700`. Base tokens serve as the foundational layer of the
color system and they are not meant to be used directly.

### Schemes

Schemes provide a comprehensive and consistent initial color palette. There are 16
different schemes defined in the system:

<Grid marginBottom="48" fillWidth gap="1" columns="4" mobileColumns="2" radius="l" overflow="hidden">
  {[
    { name: "Sand", color: "var(--scheme-sand-500)" },
    { name: "Gray", color: "var(--scheme-gray-500)" },
    { name: "Slate", color: "var(--scheme-slate-500)" },
    { name: "Red", color: "var(--scheme-red-500)" },
    { name: "Orange", color: "var(--scheme-orange-500)" },
    { name: "Yellow", color: "var(--scheme-yellow-500)" },
    { name: "Moss", color: "var(--scheme-moss-500)" },
    { name: "Green", color: "var(--scheme-green-500)" },
    { name: "Emerald", color: "var(--scheme-emerald-500)" },
    { name: "Aqua", color: "var(--scheme-aqua-500)" },
    { name: "Cyan", color: "var(--scheme-cyan-500)" },
    { name: "Blue", color: "var(--scheme-blue-500)" },
    { name: "Indigo", color: "var(--scheme-indigo-500)" },
    { name: "Violet", color: "var(--scheme-violet-500)" },
    { name: "Magenta", color: "var(--scheme-magenta-500)" },
    { name: "Pink", color: "var(--scheme-pink-500)" }
  ].map((scheme) => (
    <Flex
      padding="16"
      horizontal="center"
      align="center"
      textVariant="label-default-m"
      onSolid="neutral-strong"
      key={scheme.name}
      style={{ backgroundColor: scheme.color }}
    >
      {scheme.name}
    </Flex>
  ))}
</Grid>

### Weights

Color weights have a contrast ratio tied to them, so weights have the same contrast ratio
regardless of scheme. This makes theme management not only possible but accessible and
consistent. Contrast ratios are measured by placing the color over a pure black
background.

There are 12 weights available for each color scheme:

<Grid marginBottom="16" gap="1" columns="6" tabletColumns="3" mobileColumns="2" radius="l" overflow="hidden">
  {[
    { weight: 100, contrast: 1.05, theme: "dark" },
    { weight: 200, contrast: 1.15, theme: "dark" },
    { weight: 300, contrast: 2, theme: "dark" },
    { weight: 400, contrast: 3, theme: "dark" },
    { weight: 500, contrast: 4.5, theme: "dark" },
    { weight: 600, contrast: 7, theme: "dark" },
    { weight: 700, contrast: 10, theme: "light" },
    { weight: 800, contrast: 14, theme: "light" },
    { weight: 900, contrast: 16, theme: "light" },
    { weight: 1000, contrast: 18, theme: "light" },
    { weight: 1100, contrast: 19, theme: "light" },
    { weight: 1200, contrast: 20, theme: "light" }
  ].map((weight) => (
    <Column
      gap="4"
      padding="16"
      horizontal="center"
      align="center"
      textVariant="label-default-s"
      key={weight.weight}
      style={{ backgroundColor: `var(--scheme-cyan-${weight.weight})` }}
    >
      <Text data-theme={weight.theme} onBackground="brand-strong">
        {weight.weight}
      </Text>
      <Text
        data-theme={weight.theme}
        onBackground="brand-weak"
      >
        {weight.contrast}
      </Text>
    </Column>
  ))}
</Grid>

## Semantic tokens

Semantic tokens reference base tokens but under more descriptive names, offering enhanced
control and consistency in color selection. Semantic color tokens can be applied in 3
different ways: with component properties on the Flex, Grid, Heading and Text components;
with utility classes and with CSS variables.
