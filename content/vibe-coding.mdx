## About

Once UI is an agent-first design system that empowers indie creators to build high-quality, responsive apps — without wrestling with complexity. Designed for AI-native workflows, it turns abstract intent into concrete interfaces with minimal syntax.

## AI Workflow

Once UI uses custom tokens and props to deliver an intuitive, compact developer experience. Our philosophy: infer what you’re trying to build — even with minimal input — and Once UI applies smart defaults under the hood.

Compared to Tailwind + shadcn, Once UI yields up to **70% more compact** output, with **cleaner, more natural syntax**.

That said, most AI models aren’t yet as fluent in Once UI as they are with Tailwind. To bridge that, we’ve created tooling and patterns to help agents learn fast — and guess better over time.

## Local Repository

If your repository includes Once UI components, you can guide AI with simple, natural prompts:

<Row fillWidth vertical="end" gap="12">
    <Avatar size="s" src="/images/avatar.jpg" marginBottom="20"/>
    > I want you to implement a feed view using the `@Grid` component. Use the `@Card` component for each feed item. The card should be column direction with an `@Avatar` in the header, a `@Text` containing the name, and another one for the date. The card should have a `@Media` for the image, and two `@Text` for the title and description.
</Row>

As you build more with Once UI, AI models will learn your patterns and start suggesting better code, faster. The more you rely on real usage, the less they hallucinate.

## MCP Server

Agents can pull Once UI documentation through [Context7’s MCP server](https://context7.com/once-ui-system/mcp), supported in editors like Windsurf and Cursor.

To configure it:

1. Open `mcp_config.json` in File / Preferences / Settings / Plugins

2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart your IDE
4. Run the following code:

<Row fillWidth vertical="end" gap="12">
  <Avatar size="s" src="/images/avatar.jpg" marginBottom="20"/>
  > get-library-docs /once-ui-system/mcp
</Row>

This syncs the Once UI documentation with your local agent environment. To invoke the context, end your prompt with `use context7`.

Example:

<Row fillWidth vertical="end" gap="12">
  <Avatar size="s" src="/images/avatar.jpg" marginBottom="20"/>
  > I want you to implement [...]. use context7
</Row>

This lets your agent leverage the full Once UI system — even if it’s not installed locally.
