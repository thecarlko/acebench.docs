In the latest version of Magic Portfolio, localization is no longer supported. However, the localized version created by [François Hernandez](https://github.com/francoishernandez) is still available as a [separate branch](https://github.com/once-ui-system/magic-portfolio/tree/localization-(Once-UI-0.4.2)). This branch will not receive further updates.
