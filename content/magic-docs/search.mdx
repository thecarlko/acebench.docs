## Command palette

Magic Docs' search is powered by Once UI's Kbar component, which can be opened from the header or by pressing `Ctrl + k` or `Cmd + k`.

## Static routes

Static routes for home, changelog, and roadmap are pre-configured. When [disabling](/magic-docs/pages#static-pages) `/changelog` or `/roadmap`, the corresponding routes are automatically removed from the search results in Kbar.

## Extending Kbar

You can extend the Kbar with custom functionalities by adding new items to the `kbar` array in `src/product/Header.tsx`.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight={15}
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const kbar = [
    ...navigationKbarItems,
    ...docsItems,
    {
      id: "theme-toggle",
      name: theme === 'dark' ? "Light mode" : "Dark mode",
      section: "Theme",
      shortcut: [],
      keywords: "light mode, dark mode, theme, toggle, switch, appearance",
      perform: () => {
        setTheme(theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark');
      },
      icon: theme === 'dark' ? "light" : "dark",
    },
    // Add more items
];`, 
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/config.js"
  }
]} />
