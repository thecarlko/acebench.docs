## Appearance

You can configure the sidebar width and collapsible behavior in the `layout` object of the `resources/config.js` file.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`sidebar: {
    width: 16, // width of the sidebar
    collapsible: true, // accordion or static render
},`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "resources/config.js"
  }
]} />

## Default behavior

Magic Docs' sidebar structure is automatically generated based on the hierarchy of your `src/content` directory, and handles nested folders. By default, the section titles are generated from the directory names and the order is alphabetical.

## Overrides

You can override the default section titles generated based on the directory names by adding a `meta.json` file in the directories. You can also specify custom page orders in this file.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="3"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`{
    "title": "Magic Portfolio",
    "order": 2,
    "pages": {
      "quick-start": 1,
      "pages": 2,
      "styling": 3,
      "content": 4,
      "work": 5,
      "blog": 6,
      "mailchimp": 7,
      "localization": 8,
      "seo": 9
    }
}`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "resources/config.js"
  }
]} />

The code above will ensure that the title of the section is "Magic Portfolio" and it's the second element in the sidebar. It also defines the order of the pages in the section.

## Extras

You can display additional elements for each navigation element such as tag or icon by modifying the corresponding frontmatter.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="5-8"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`---
title: "Changelog"
summary: "Set up and customize the changelog of your documentation site."
updatedAt: "2025-03-17"
navLabel: "Changelog"
navIcon: "list"
navTag: "New"
navTagVariant: "blue"
---`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/content/magic-docs/changelog.mdx"
  }
]} />

The frontmatter above will display a tag with the text "New" and the color "blue" next to the navigation element in the right, and a list icon next to the navigation element in the left.

The tag variant accepts the following values: `blue`, `indigo`, `violet`, `magenta`, `pink`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `moss`, `green`, `emerald`, `aqua`, `cyan`.
