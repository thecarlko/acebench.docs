## Static pages

Magic Docs' `RouteGuard` component takes care of conditionally rendering pages based on the `routes` object.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="3"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const routes = {
    '/changelog': true,
    '/roadmap':   false,
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "resources/config.js"
  }
]} />

The code above will ensure that the `/roadmap` page is not accessible and is not displayed in the navigation and in search results.

## Dynamic pages

Magic Docs generates pages from `.mdx` files in the `src/content` directory. You can add the files in subdirectories to create a nested structure for the navigation. Learn more about customizing the navigation in the [sidebar](/magic-docs/sidebar) section.

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is used to set the page's metadata: title, summary, updatedAt, navLabel, and navIcon. It's used in the page's header and in meta- and open graph tags.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="11-12"
    codes={[
      {
        code:
`---
title: "Changelog"
summary: "Changelog of Magic Docs."
updatedAt: "2025-03-16"
navLabel: "Changelog"
navIcon: "changelog"
navTag: "New"
navTagVariant: "blue"
---`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "src/content/changelog.mdx"
      }
    ]}
/>

### MDX syntax

You can use MDX to write the content of your projects. It helps you write rich and dynamic content with minimal code. Some MDX elements will be automatically transformed to Once UI components to integrate better in the design and add additional functionality.

### Components

You can see the list of available components available in the [components](/magic-docs/components) section.

### Hot reload

Hot reload of MDX files is currently not supported, but we're working on it.
